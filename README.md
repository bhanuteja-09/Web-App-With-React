1.Project Setup: Created a React project using create-react-app or similar tool.

2.Components: Created reusable React components like UserDataForm and UserDataDisplay for managing user data input and display.

3.State Management: Utilized React useState hook to manage state within functional components for capturing and displaying user data.
4.Effect Hook: Used the useEffect hook to perform side effects like fetching data from local storage and updating component state.

5.Routing: Implemented navigation using React Router useNavigate hook to navigate between pages or components.

6.Styling: Applied CSS styles to components using CSS files (UserDataForm.css) and global styles (App.css) for consistent styling across the application.

7.Local Storage: Stored user data persistently in the browser's local storage using localStorage API to retain data across page reloads.

8.Readme File: Created a README file (README.md) to document project structure, dependencies, setup instructions, and other relevant information for users and contributors.

9.Project Structure: Organized project files into directories like components, pages, and styles for better code organization and maintainability.

10.Error Handling: Implemented error handling and validation to ensure proper data input and prevent application crashes.

Overall, you've built a basic React application that allows users to input and display their data, persistently storing it in the browser's local storage, and provided documentation for users and contributors to understand the project structure and how to use it.1.
